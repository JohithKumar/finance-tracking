# finance trackre

This project is a simple personal finance tracker built using Python and SQLAlchemy ORM with a SQLite database.

It helps users manage their daily expenses, categories, budgets, and subscriptions in an organized way.

The system allows creating different expense categories so that transactions can be grouped properly.

Users can add transactions by entering amount, description, date, and category ID.

It also provides options to update or delete transactions whenever changes are required.

Transactions can be searched easily using a specific date to view spending details.

The application can generate a category-wise summary that shows total spending for each category.

Users can set monthly budgets for different categories to control their expenses.

A budget alert feature compares total spending with the budget limit and notifies when the limit is exceeded.

The project also includes a subscription tracking feature to store recurring expenses like OTT, apps, or services.

It uses SQLAlchemy relationships to connect categories, transactions, and budgets efficiently.

The database is created automatically using ORM models when the program runs.

The project is menu-driven and works completely through the console interface.

It is useful for learning database handling, ORM concepts, and basic financial management logic in Python.
